# `combineSlices`

## Overview

A function that combines slices into a single reducer, and enables injection of more reducers after initialisation.

## Parameters

`combineSlices` accepts a set of [slices](./createSlice.mdx), RTKQ API [instances](/rtk-query/api/created-api/overview.mdx), and/or reducer map objects, and combines them into a single reducer.

Slices (and API instances) will be mounted at their `reducerPath`, and items from reducer map objects will be mounted under their respective key.

```ts no-transpile
const rootReducer = combineSlices(counterSlice, baseApi, {
  user: userSlice.reducer,
  auth: authSlice.reducer,
})
// is like
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  [counterSlice.reducerPath]: counterSlice.reducer,
  [baseApi.reducerPath]: baseApi.reducer,
  user: userSlice.reducer,
  auth: authSlice.reducer,
})
```

:::caution

If multiple slices/map objects have the same reducer path, the reducer provided later in the arguments will override the previous.

However, typing will not be able to account for this. It's best to ensure that all of your reducers will aim for a unique location.

:::

:::warning

Like [`combineReducers`](https://redux.js.org/api/combinereducers), `combineSlices` requires at least one reducer at initialisation.

```ts no-transpile
// will throw an error
const rootReducer = combineSlices()
```

:::

## Return Value

`combineSlices` returns a reducer function, with attached methods.

```ts
// file: slices/api.ts noEmit
import type { Api } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query'

export declare const api: Api<() => any, {}, 'api', never>

// file: slices/users.ts noEmit
import type { Slice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

export declare const userSlice: Slice<string, {}, 'user'>

// file: slices/index.ts
import { combineSlices } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import { api } from './api'
import { userSlice } from './users'

export const rootReducer = combineSlices(api, userSlice)

// file: store.ts
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import { rootReducer } from './slices'

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
})
```

### `withLazyLoadedSlices`

### `inject`

:::note

A "slice" for `combineSlices` is typically created with [`createSlice`](./createSlice.mdx), but can be any object with `reducerPath` and `reducer` properties.

```ts no-transpile
const withUserReducer = rootReducer.inject({
  reducerPath: 'user',
  reducer: userReducer,
})
```
